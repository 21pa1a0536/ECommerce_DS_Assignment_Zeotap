# eCommerce Transactions Dataset Analysis

This project contains a comprehensive analysis of an eCommerce Transactions dataset. The objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build a lookalike model, and segment customers using clustering techniques. The entire project is completed in a single Google Colab notebook.

**Tasks Completed**

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed the dataset to extract insights about customer behavior and product trends.
Generated business insights from the data.

# Lookalike Model:

Developed a model to recommend similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
Generated a list of top 3 lookalike customers for the first 20 customers.

# Customer Segmentation:

Applied clustering techniques to segment customers based on their profile and transactions.
Evaluated clustering performance using relevant metrics like DB Index.
